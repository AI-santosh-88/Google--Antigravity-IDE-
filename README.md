## 📘 PROJECT : 

Calculator Application Using Google Antigravity IDE

1. Abstract

This project focuses on the development of a Calculator Application using Google Antigravity IDE. The application is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The main objective of this project is to provide a simple, efficient, and user-friendly calculator while enhancing understanding of programming logic and application development.

2. Introduction

A calculator is one of the most commonly used tools in daily life for performing mathematical operations. With the growth of software applications, digital calculators have become more efficient and accessible. This project demonstrates how a basic calculator can be developed using programming concepts and an integrated development environment (IDE).

The Calculator Application accepts numerical input from the user, processes the data based on the selected operation, and displays the result instantly.
